 Overview of This Report
The research focuses on leveraging genetic information to diagnose diabetes-using classification
and clustering approaches using machine-learning algorithms. It seeks to discover segments
within the diabetic community by using precise classification models and clustering techniques.
The research also evaluates the effectiveness and comprehension of the created models for use in
clinical settings. By attaining these goals, the dissertation hopes to advance the identification of
diabetes by presenting more precise and individualized diagnostic techniques, exposing disease
heterogeneity, and enhancing the treatment and care of patients outcomes.
